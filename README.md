# PacMen

Project title: PacMen project

Project Description: Thie project allows the user to create images of PacMan and then bounces these
images around a pre-determined area at random speeds and in random directions.

How to run: Download index.html, pacmen.js, the four .png files to the same folder. Run index.html
in web browswer, either by dragging and dropping the file into the web browser, selecting the web
browser under the "open with" tab, or any other method. The program will then run in your browswer
window.

Future improvements: This project can be enhanced in the future by adding more styles to improve the
user interface. Additionally, the JavaScript code could be modified so that the PacMen bounce off of
each other in realistic ways as determined by their velocity and angle of impact.
